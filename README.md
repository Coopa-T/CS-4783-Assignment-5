# CS-4783-Assignment-5 Optional assignment

To execute the program for Question 4 you need to input a image, it's mean, and it's index to run the Assign5Q4.ipynb. It will then prompt you change the number of clusters or colors within the image as it compresses the image that you entered. You do need to provide a image in the same folder for the code to accept the image. You may use the picture of Q4Data.png in this repository to test the program.
